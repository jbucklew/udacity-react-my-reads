# MyReads

This application works like a bookshelf and allows users to manage books they 'Want to Read', are 'Currently Reading' or have 'Read'.  Books can be found and added to the bookshelf from the provided search page.  Search terms are limited and can be found in the included [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md) file. Use the menu located on each book to add, change or remove it from the bookshelf.


To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
